			<h2>2nd of Granite, 255, Early Spring</h2>
			<p><span style="font-family: 'Glass Antiqua', cursive; font-size: 48px;">T</span>he ride up to Zimoltar, "Crestedgilt" was peaceful. The wind rolled the grass like waves on a beach, the trees swayed back and forth like arms swinging a farewell, the mountains climbed and fell like the Gods' stairways along the earth.</p>
			<p>I felt that the position I sought as Crestedgilt's new Overseer was my destiny. My purpose.</p>
			<p>The carriage ride was bumpy. I listened to the rocks abuse the wooden wheels of the wagon as my best friend and most-trusted advisor, <strong>Gylis II</strong>, pushed the horses to their limits. We had little time to spare, as the word we had received last week from his father did not bode well.</p>
			<p>For some odd, dumbfounded reason, previous Overseers had been running Crestedgilt for only a year, then retiring either to leave or to step-down and become a lesser-role dwarf, like a miner or carpenter. It's because of this that Crestedgilt had been very poorly managed, and they now sought a new <strong><em>professional</em></strong> Overseer to repair the damage done. That's where I come in.</p>
			<p>Ah! The horses have stopped! At last we have arrived. Let us see what work must be done!</p>

			<p>Where to begin? AH! The smell! It hits your nostrils the second the carriage door cracked open. It bears a resemblance to the odor of a rotten fish left too close to a magma smelter for a week and then piling 30 dead corpses on top of it, because there are <strong>BODIES EVERYWHERE</strong>. If not a body, then a body part. Granted most of them are goblin, there are pieces of dwarf blood and clothing here and there. What in the hell happened?</p>
