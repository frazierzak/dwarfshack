I asked him to go to the hospital immediately as someone could slip and injure themselves on the blood he's leaving behind. He told me there was no hospital. I then quickly set him to digging out a massive room for the future hospital. I'm putting it next to the living quarters as I believe most of the injured are already bed-ridden.</p>
			<p>I then moved all of the animals outside to the pasture. If I stepped in one more pile of dung I was going to lose it.<a href="images/suc_img/year5_12.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year5_12.png" /></a> Also, I'd like to note we somehow have a tamed wolverine. Yes. A wolverine.</p>

			<p>Decided it was time for me to have my own quarters. This seems good a place as any, next to the tomb of Dee-Em VII</p>

			<p>Yes, that's sand. A dining hall in a room made of sand. I almost chipped a molar on a granule. What's worse was there was no booze to wash it down! Everything in this place makes me angry. So my next project is a "<strong>Grand Dining Hall</strong>" which will be three rooms' height, with gigantic pillars and hundreds of tables and thrones made out of the finest stone.</p>
