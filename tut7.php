			<p>Shallow metals (the first layer of rock you hit will likely have metal in it).</p>
			<p>Deep metals (MORE METAL).</p>
			<p>And Flux, which will allow steel smithing later.</p>
			<p>We also have a stream, a hot climate (which will evaporate my lakes most of the year), lots of trees, thick vegetation, and the <a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Surroundings" target="_blank">surroundings</a> are classified as Wilderness, which is middle ground for hostile wild life… not good, not evil.  Your surroundings will greatly effect your game, so check out the wiki for a brief guide.</p>
			<p>Time to <strong>"e"</strong>mbark!</p>
			<p>The next screen allows you to prepare your party before venturing forth.  You only have so many points to spend, so choose wisely!  The LNP has a few default templates which are very serviceable.  I’ll build my preferred party here for you by <strong>"preparing for the journey carefully"</strong>.</p>

		<p><a href="images/tut_img/worldgen3.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="World Generator"><img  width="50%" class="right" src="images/tut_img/worldgen3.jpg"/></a>Here we have my first 7 dwarves, all with no <a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Skills">skills</a>.  Hitting TAB, we also have a default set of gear which we will adjust a bit, and lastly, no animals added on yet.  Keep in mind that any dwarf can technically do any job, as long as you designate it for them (through Dwarf Therapist, preferably).  These skill points simply boost a stat or two for certain dwarves.  A list of skills is also available on the wiki, as well as descriptions of each skill.  Note that some are, right now, USELESS… or very close to useless.</p>
		<p>Arrow left and right to switch between the dwarf and his skills, and + and – to distribute them.  There are two or three screens worth of skills, so scroll up and down.  If you want to go into great detail, you can also “v”iew each dwarf to see their personalities, appearance, and capabilities!  The only time this is of great importance is when choosing a leader / book keeper, and fighting dwarves.  Almost everyone else can suffice at most other jobs.  Dwarven attributes cannot be changed.</p>
