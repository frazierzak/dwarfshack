			<p>Besides the vampire problem and all of my children that were born in autumn causing a ruckus in our halls, and the relentless siege at our doors things have been relatively quiet.  I ordered the miners to dig, and so they have.  They will dig until they die, and they probably will.  First, though, we will dig out the sand so that our mushrooms can grow into something that we can use for wood.  The rooms to the south are never to be built in, as they are growing what will be our wood.  All who defy these orders will be killed.</p>

			<h2>2nd Opal</h2>
			<p>It seems that bolange has done it again.  The second siege of the Great Reign of Conandan the Barbarian Dwarf of Fear and Lamentation has ended.  It appears that bolange has one useful trait, other than standing around and staring at the young boys and eating at the food barrel.  We continue to dig in the sand and clay.  Its not stone, and the diggers are complaining that they are beneath this type of work.  Too fucking bad, we need beds and wood.</p>
			<p>And some god damn traders have arrived.  It would be nice to trade with them, however, the last rulers didn't leave good notes on their switches in the switch room, and it seems that the draw bridge is not labeled well.  I fear hitting the wrong switch could flood the chambers.  More investigation is necessary.
			<h2>5th Opal</h2>
			<p>The lever labeled for the bridge, and what seems to link to the bridge, does not work.  Terrible engineers are terrible.  We need wood and supplies desperately.  The siege has lifted for the moment, this would be an excellent time to invite these peasants into our home.</p>
