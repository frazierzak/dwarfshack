			<p>Hit F1 and let’s pick a place to dig.  Just south of my wagon, I’m going to make a 2x2 square of down-stairs in the Earth by hitting "d"esignations, and then "j".  Looking at this screen, note that everything you can "d"esignate is something that already exists: we're designating something that exists to be changed.  This differs from "b"uild, where we are creating something that does not yet exist!  Keep that in mind if you ever get stuck hanging with no stairs somewhere.</p> 
			<p>In DF, you can now PAINT designations with your mouse, rather than space around with your cursor only, but obviously for square shapes it’s just as simple either way.  Paint an area of 2x2 with down-stairs, or else position the cursor at one corner, hit enter, and move one space over and one space down, and hit the enter key again.</p>
			<p><a href="images/tut_img/stairs.jpg"><img class="right" width="30%" src="images/tut_img/stairs.jpg"/></a>There’s my 2x2 of down-stairs.</p>
			Additionally, before we un-pause, I want to tell our Carpenter to begin cutting down trees, and I want to designate some plants to be picked.  So, the “d”esignation for chopping down trees is “t” for tree.  Now pick a place just northwest of your stairs and right-click, your cursor will jump to that spot.  Hit enter.  Now right-click just southeast of your stairs and hit enter again.</p>

			<p><a href="images/tut_img/trees.jpg"><img width="40%" class="right" src="images/tut_img/trees.jpg"/></a>There, now we’ve designated stairs to be cut into the ground, and trees to be chopped.  One more thing, “d”esignate some “p”lants to be gathered.  Choose about the same area as your trees.</p>
			<p>Ok!  Unpause and watch your dwarves work for a bit.  The stairs will get cut quickly and the miners will wander back to the wagon.</p>
			<p>Keep watching.  You’ll notice the Carpenter moving about from tree to tree (and leaving the wood there on the ground), but nobody is gathering.  Why?  Because we haven’t given that job to anyone yet, whereas we previously made our own specialized Carpenter (and miners).  A dwarf can be an expert gatherer, and he will sit on his ass unless you give him the job.</p>
			<p>We need Dwarf Therapist!  Before that though, let’s put the miners to work for a while.  Go down one Z – level with > and look, we see a square of unmined dirt (or in this case sandy loam) under our stairs.  We don’t want to MINE it, because then it would be stairs leading to… air.  What we want is to “d”esignate some up/down stairs with “i”.  Paint up/down stairs directly onto the square we have and then let the miners do their thing.</p>
