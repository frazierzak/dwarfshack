			<p><span style="font-family: 'Glass Antiqua', cursive; font-size: 48px;">I</span>’m not a DF master by any means, I started playing a few years ago and I’ve regained interest about once a year or so, or whenever a new version lands.  DF is like a psychosis, and it’s rare that someone learn ALL its features and shortcuts!  However I should be able to help beginners get started and get a grasp of the game… up until 150 dwarves or so and things *start* getting complicated.</p>
			<p>It’s possible I get a detail wrong here or there!  If you see something that looks incorrect, or something that you feel needs more clarification, call me out on the chatty or PM me and I’ll rectify it.</p>
			<p>For this tutorial I’ll be using the loadout that we’ll be using for the Shack DF Succession games, so any screens will be using the Phoebus tileset.  Please note that the embark chosen WILL NOT look anything like what I show here (probably) in that I’m going to choose a relatively flat and warm place with lots of trees.  More likely, for Succession we will have Z+ and Z- levels of terrain (hills and valleys).</p>

			<p>Most people start DF and immediately feel overwhelmed; that’s natural.  Once you play for a while, the common commands become muscle memory and you won’t have to hunt around for what you need.</p>
            <p>Part One will focus on the bare beginnings of DF.  Getting the game, how the world generates, and so on.  This will all be done for you for the Succession game but it’s mandatory if you’re a beginner. </p> 
			<p>Part two will be actually designing your fort, preparing its defenses, feeding and caring for your dwarves, and establishing an economy of sorts.</p>
