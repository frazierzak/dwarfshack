			<h2>21 Granite</h2>
			<p>New migrants have arrived, despite the danger.  27 of them, to be precise.  The drawbridge is down and they can assist with the cleanup, the sooner we can get back underground the better, and I can see about our troublesome bloodthirsty mayor.  And maybe get some engineering done!</p>
			<h2>6 Felsite</h2>
			<p>Many fallen brothers and sisters are being reclaimed from the cruel outdoors and as such, their spirits are being laid to rest.  Additionally, a wild black bear has gorged himself on no less than 50 kegs of Dwarven alcohol left out in the open from one of the traders.  Confound it!  I have chased away the bear and we are slowly claiming the remnants of the caravan, hopefully there's some more useful stuff in there that did't get savaged by the wildlife.  Kudos to the bear though, surely he had dwarven ancestors.</p>

            <p>There is no sign of the Minotaur.  As such I'm letting the cleanup continue while I begin to address two important things: getting rid of our resident vampires, and starting two important engineering problems... one project will be to generate enough MAGMA to power some forges, and the other... is top secret.</p>
			<h2>8 Hematite</h2>

			<p>I have moved all the dwarves with no combat experience into the outpost and raised the drawbridge.  Cleverly, I also added our esteemed mayor to the military, and she will be scouting out the location of this siege!</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, a caravan of elven traders is trapped with us inside our fort.  Mayhap we will be forced to eat them.</p>
