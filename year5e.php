			<h2>13th of Felsite, 255, Late Spring</h2>
			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_15.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year5_15.png" /></a>Work on the new Grand Dining Hall is underway as I channel out the top level, leaving 4 rock columns which will support the ceiling. I've put 5 more dwarves to dig, most of them have never held a pick-axe before but hell, this is a great time to learn!</p>
			<h2>1st Hematite, 255, Early Summer</h2>
			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_16.png"><img class="left" src="images/suc_img/year5_16.png" /></a>It is Summer! The Grand Dining Hall is still the main project as of late. </p>
			<p>The booze stocks are now secure, as well. Things seem to be getting on track, now. All it took was a little love from an Overseer who cares. </p>

			<p>Gylis II reminds me again of my promise to find his father. It had completely slipped my mind so I task a group of dwarves to start preparing for a journey into the caverns. Dwarves tell me stories of two forgotten beasts that roam the caverns and that was the last time Gylis was seen. They said he had been sent to recover spider webs or something trivial.</p>
			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_17.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year5_17.png" /></a>Not even 2 hours later, they return with grim news. While digging peek-holes into the cavern down below, they found Gylis's body. Gylis II did not take the news well and started suiting armor on. He wanted to recover his father's body even if it killed him.</p>
			<p>I'm not sure how we can retrieve it, though. The dwarves tell me of seeing two separate beast that are not to be stirred or I'll risk death to every dwarf here. I start to plan out a way to do this without losing one dwarf.</p>
			<p>Elven traders also stopped by and I traded a few rock crafts for every piece of wood they had. The trees to the south seem to be gone.</p>
