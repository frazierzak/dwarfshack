			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_21.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year5_21.png" /></a>Sorry for the abrupt ending to my previous entry, time was of the essence but all has been handled well. The squads mutilated the forgotten beast, known as "<strong>Sut</strong>", quickly in the stairwell.</p>
			<h2>17th of Malachite 255, Mid Summer</h2>
			<p>Victory again! The military here is phenomenal and have definitely earned their rest for the day. The beast known as "<strong>Yetine</strong>" has also been slain.</p>

			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_23.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year5_23.png" /></a>I've recovered Gylis's body and laid him to rest. I made what seemed to be a previous ruler's memorial hall into his burial tomb. It seemed fitting. Gylis II has been in a best mood that I've seen in months.</p>
			<p>Now back to work on the Grand Dining Hall!</p>

			<p>A Human caravan has arrived. I have no need for anything at the moment so I quickly turn them away.</p>
			<h2>1st Limestone, 255, Early Autumn</h2>
			<p>Autumn is here! The population sits at around 150 dwarves now. The Grand Dining Hall is coming along great and I've been able to harvest large mushrooms in the caverns below for extra wood.</p>

			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_24.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year5_24.png" /></a>Work on the Dining Hall is still the main focus. I've had troubles with some ghosts so I've been arranging memorial services for those still not found. I've had to erect scaffolding to smooth the stones of the grand pillars in the Dining Hall.</p>
