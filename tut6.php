			<p><span style="font-family: 'Glass Antiqua', cursive; font-size: 48px;">S</span>crolling around the map now, you will see three views:  Local, region, and world.  The local map represents the highest magnification, and within the local map you can move your embark point around with u,m,k, and h.  The region map gives you a birds-eye view of the world and you navigate this with the arrow keys, it’s also the best place to watch for features like mountains, forests, and the temperament of the zone (beware evil areas!).  As you scroll around the region map, you will see the local map change and your position on the world will change accordingly.</p>
			<p>The World map will never scroll, it’s a satellite-view of the whole realm.</p>
			<p>Remember, your actual playing field will consist of only what your embark point covers!  NOT the whole local map.  You CAN change the size of your embark point, but it’s not recommended.</p>
			<p>I’m going to scroll around and find a relatively flat place (for ease) in a warm climate, which also has some trees and vegetation.  Additionally, I’m looking for metals and FLUX STONE, which is the stuff necessary to eventually forge STEEL.</p>

        <div id="cont_right">
		<p>Additionally, hitting TAB will cycle through new views.  Make sure your NEIGHBORS are all available (if you want them to be), including elves, humans, and goblins.  Embarking on a lone island will probably give you ONLY DWARVES as neighbors, and you WILL NOT see anyone else visiting or trading with you or trying to kill you except for native wildlife and/or zombies if you’re in an evil area.</p>
		<p>Also keep in mind that large lakes and oceans will have salt water instead of fresh, and this will make things more complicated during game play since dwarves cannot drink salt water, it has to be desalinated with a pump.  Embarking close by, you will get a notice pop up on your screen if your area as salt water.</p>
		<p>You can also choose which dwarven civilization you want to be a part of, and that civ will be highlighted in BLUE on the world map.  You can see mine is just south of the center ocean.  Proximity to your civilization will affect how soon and how often dwarves come to trade.</p>
		<p>There’s also an elevation tab and a cliff indicator tab, which will tell you how steep the terrain is.</p>
