			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year3_11.jpg"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year3_11.jpg" /></a>Casualties have mostly ceased, and we are burying our dead.  However, a builder died from infection today, so our grief continues to mount.  We also continue to have problems with great horned owl people, who fly over our walls and harass us near the ill-considered back door at the top of the mountain.  We have paved over the stairs into the fort itself at this location, but dwarves still wander up there from time to time.</p>
			<p>I have also begun the construction of additional mason's workshops on the level with the entrance.  We now have seven builders to address the demands of constructing fortifications and cutting stone furniture.  We may need more in the future.</p>
			<h2>16 Felsite</h2>
			<p>An elven caravan arrived today... and so did a goblin ambush.  They killed many who were venturing outside to bring in the dead, and drove off the caravan.  We will have vengeance... if we can stop the bleeding.</p>

			<h2>26 Felsite</h2>
			<p>Hope is fading.  Most of our defenders have been killed outside our gates by the goblin ambushers, who rage unabated.  We cannot link up the bridge for their harassment.</p>

			<p>Most seriously, today one of our legendary diggers, the esteemed Dee-Em VII, went insane from grief.  He is now rampaging about the fortress.  I do not know how we will contain him, or what we will do without his skill.</p>

			<h2>7 Hematite</h2>
			<p>We were forced to slay Dee-Em VII.  However, the bloodletting continues unabated.  Our new conscripts are untrained and poorly equipped and cannot prevent the rampages of the goblin ambushers.  We have pulled back to the safehouse but many, many dwarves have died.  Including my wife and child.</p>
