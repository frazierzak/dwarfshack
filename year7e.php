			We have started construction on the great sleeping level. All are thankfully that the Glorious Leader Conandan the Barbarian Dwarf of Fear and Lamentation had the vision to create such a wondrous thing.</p>

			That dumb caravan waited around until the goblins came back!  HA!  Idiots.  The stone smoothers are moving along on the great sleeping level.  Everyone is excited.  Back at the start I forgot that I had told a mason to start making block and never told him to stop.  We have so much block its funny.  I should make a statue of myself out of it.  Instead, I think that we should use it for good.  Place it around our top most levels so that we have areas to grow trees and plants un-hindered.</p>

			<p>My time is done.  I cannot stand another year at the job.  It has been a long road to fix the problems created by previous leaders, and my toenails have grown long.  They are not all finished, but I feel as the Great and Glorious leader who lived in the mountains and came down from a complete rainbow riding on a unicorn that I have left this place better than when I started.  Gylis's tomb has been defiled so that future generations will not learn of his savage love of animal anuses.  I fear that the few among us who are strong, will fall because of the decisions of the weak.  I hope that this does not come true.  We need beds, and wood.  The rooms to grow shroom trees are set up as long as they are not disturbed we will have a good stand of wood shortly.  The great sleeping level is nearing functional completion.  The levers need help as we cannot leave STAR DEATH FORTRESS during times of peace to collect plants and wood.</p>
