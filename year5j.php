			<p><strong>I'm done</strong>. I thought I could make this 'Overseer' thing work, but I was wrong. I like to give orders, but I hate to deal with the consequences. I don't like the blood or the death, and especially the smell that goes with both.</p>
			<p>I'm stepping down today, demoting myself to "Manager". The siege still burns strongly outside the gates. I will retire to my corporate quarters and one day be buried in my Grand Mausoleum which is the <strong>Bembul Grand Hall</strong>. How lucky I am to someday rest in that magnificent room.</p>
