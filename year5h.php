			<p>So there must be another vampire on the loose in the fortress. Hunting vampires wasn't on the job application nor was it on my resume, so I'll leave that to someone else. I'm starting to rethink my current role as Overseer, here. Many dwarves are upset their children being missing. I put an amber alert out on some stone slabs but I guess that wasn't enough.</p>

			<h2>17th of Sandstone, 255, Mid-Autumn</h2>
			<p>Sad news from back home as my son, Dastot, arrived unexpectedly. My wife and his mother, Bembul, was mauled by a wolverine last month. The doctors sent me the diagnostic and it was straight to the point:</p>
			<p align="center"><a href="images/suc_img/year5_26.png"><img class="bigcenter" src="images/suc_img/year5_26.png" /></a>
			<p>Yet she still lives! So bless the Gods, I suppose. It makes me think twice about the tame one we keep outside. I have no urge to travel home now, the sight of her may ruin the way she'd want me to remember her by. I'm finding the Dining Hall to be the only thing I look forward to working on each day. In her name I will call it the <strong>Bembul Grand Hall</strong>. I also wish to be buried within its walls, so I ordered my son to begin work on a tomb immediately. Winter is coming.</p>

			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_27.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year5_27.png" /></a>Winter is here. Finally dug out the bottom floor of the dining hall. Now I just have to get all of this stone out of here! I quickly put all of the children to task and designate a dump pile outside in the hallway. </p>
			<p>Many dwarves have been dropping off gifts and trinkets hearing the news of my wife. All have been so kind except for the mayor who left a note to <a href="images/suc_img/year5_28.png"> deliver a pewter chest to his quarters</a>, immediately.</p>
			<p>I accidentally <em>misplaced</em> the note.</p>
			<h2>18th of Moonstone, 255, Early Winter</h2>
			<p>Just when things were going smoothly, I receive word from the guards that a beast was heard down below in the caverns. When I asked what beast could put the fear of the Gods into them, they replied with one word:</p>
			<h1 align="center"><em>Rabbit</em></h1>
