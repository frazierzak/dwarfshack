			<p>NOW, looking at my list, I want to add a couple of “n”ew items.   Some new dwarven drink (wine, ale, rum, anything) and some eggs (the cheapest available), I want 20 of each.  This pads my food and drink supply in case I have to spend longer setting up my farm / meat industry and brewing!  Dwarves without alcohol get grumpy very quickly, and dwarves with no food will starve.  Or go mad.</p>
			<p>I’m also going to bump my existing supply of plump helmets to 20, and I’m going to add one additional copper pick, because I want to have three miners as soon as possible.  The first lazy migrant will get this job, and I don’t want to have to wait until I set up a metal industry to make a new pick.</p>

			<h2 style="text-align: center;">STRIKE THE EARTH!</h2>
			<p>The goal of Dwarf Fortress is to survive and prosper with as many dwarves as possible for as long as possible, building great feats of engineering, eventually amassing an unsurpassable army, fitting them with the best armor and weapons, and besting even the demons of Hell itself!  (And to have FUN along the way, tell some epic stories, and learn as you go.) But most forts die early, and from silly things.</p>
			<p>It would take a long, long time to completely list all the available things to do and all the ways to succeed in DF; the game is about as open ended as you can get.  “Sandbox” doesn’t come close.  You can mine the finest gems, train a jeweler to cut the stones just right, set them in the best platinum master crafted finery, and trade it for the entire stock of a trading wagon… or you can do the same thing with a master chef and a fine meal made with dwarven syrup.  Build an army and patrol the surrounding country, or engineer traps and let invaders die foolishly in the first hallway they come to.  It’s up to you!</p>
