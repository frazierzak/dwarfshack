			<h2>2 Obsidian</h2>
			<p>The labors and grief of the past year have taken their toll on me.  Soon it will be time for me to pass the torch to a younger administrator, someone better equipped to usher in the next era of Zimoltar's glory. Someone who can tap the magma, extract the threads of the precious adamantine, kill the minotaur and avenge our dead. I turn now to the completion of my baronial quarters.  It seems only a just reward for my faithful service to dwarvenkind.</p>
			<p>Also, another of the diggers is missing. Hmm...</p>
			<h2>16 Obsidian</h2>
			<p>The grief has nearly overcome me.  As my final act, I have erected a slab to one of the great departed builders of Crestedgilt, Sparkly Adilgusash.  May he rest in peace.</p>

			<p>Also, the lady mayor is a <em><strong>vampire</strong></em>.  Good luck with that.</p>
