			<p>Hit “I”, place the cursor in the center tile, and hit enter.  The available zone types will be highlighted, this is just informational at this point.  Hit enter again, there’s our single tile zone.  It’s active, but there’s no activity assigned to it yet, choose to make it a “g”arbage dump.  Then arrow away from it, we have our zone.  Now, anything we are going to “d”esignate the stones on Z-5 to be garbage, and the dwarves will begin to move them to the dump, all taking up just one tile.  Go to Z-5, “d”, “b” for item properties, “d”ump items.  Highlight all the stones with your mouse and they will change color.  Escape back to the menu, unpause, and the dwarves will begin hauling stone!  Except our miners… we turned hauling off for those two.</p>	
			<p><a href="images/tut_img/garbage.jpg"><img class="right" src="images/tut_img/garbage.jpg" width="30%"/></a>Soon we will have a nice clean room.  But we will want to use that stone eventually… it’s not actually garbage!  So go back to our garbage pile when the room is clean and re”c”laim them with one click: “d”, “b”, “c”, click the garbage zone.  All that stone is now off the garbage list, and in a nice pile, right next to our workshops.  You will want to do this often; mine out an area and set the stones to garbage.  Just remember to occasionally come back to the garbage zone and reclaim everything in that tile.</p>

			<p>Now we want to give a task to that workshop.  We want to make ten wooden beds.  Hit “q” and arrow over near the shop and “a”dd a new task.  Construct a “b”ed.  Add another task, make another bed, and queue these up until you have ten (the maximum).</p>
			<p>Our Carpenter will grab some wood from the pile on Z-3, bring it to the shop, make a bed, and then place the bed in the furniture pile!  After all ten are made he will go back to hauling, or be idle.<p>
			<p><strong>HERE IS A VERY USEFUL TRICK</strong>.  Go to Z-5 and look at our dorm room, most likely it is cluttered with stone, including perhaps some laying in the stairwell.  We don’t like clutter and it slows down our dwarves, although technically we can place furniture on top of it… let’s move this stuff to someplace useful, like the center tile in our workshop room.  We COULD just make a 1x1 pile, but it would only hold one stone.  Instead, we are going to create a ZONE with “I” and make it a single tile right in the center of the room.</p>
