			<p><span style="font-family: 'Glass Antiqua', cursive; font-size: 48px;">T</span>here's a new sheriff in town.  More accurately, we actually have a sheriff now.  Technically I'm the Captain of the Guard but it's really all the same.  I wasn't elected or anything like that but rather this is a bold grab for power.  Things here in CrestedGuilt have been too laissez-faire for too long and its cost us the lives of too many good dwarfs.  Someone is going to have to sieze control of this place and put us on the path to prosperity and glory.  I may not be the sheriff that CrestedGuilt deserves, but I'm the one it needs right now.</p>
			<p>Where do I even begin.  By Armok, things here are so disorderly and hodgepodge you'd think it was a one of those inelegant human camps, not a future gem of dwarven civilization.  We are beset by many obstacles.  While we have a vile force of darkness camped outside of our gates waiting to slip in during a moment of weakness we should not lose sight of the enemy within--there have been several of our kin found drained of blood.  We have a vampire in our midst!</p>
			<p>In order to confront these challenges I will require chambers in which to sequester myself and plan for our future.  I rapidly sketched a mining layout to give myself an office to conduct business as well as dining and sleeping facilities in order to keep myself focused in my solitude and ensure a clear head and then dispatched dwarves to being it's construction. </p>

			<p>While whipping the population into shape I feel the need to give them a grand project to keep their feeble minds occupied and their idle hands busy.  With access to the surface unavailable we are going to need a water source and I have a grand vision for bring water to my people.  The plans for a basic aquaduct and sewer system are also laid in place.</p>
