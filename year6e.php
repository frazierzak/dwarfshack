			<h2>24th Limestone, 256</h2>
			<p>Erith Zuntirtolis completed his masterwork today.  He calls it "Crowlash".  Clearly this dwarf has some issues as he's made a glass animal trap and decorated it with the leather from a forgotten beast.  He then decorated that with images of a giant parakeet and a demon rat.  I'm going to keep a close eye on this Erith fellow...</p>

			<h2>20 Timber, 256</h2>
			<p>We have two causes for celebration.  First off, the seige has left.  We are free to gather plants and what little lumber exists outside once again.  Secondly, and more importantly, the waterworks are completed!  While the flow is not great enough to enable the second waterfall (nor enough to rinse the Pit of Justice it seems), drainage appears to be adequate and we don't seem to be in danger of flooding.  The dwarves seem to love the light mist the waterfall generates in our grand meeting hall and I'm hesitant to shut it down for now to burrow out a larger pipe to our second waterfall.  I would much rather let it run for a while to ensure there is no risk of flood before increasing the amount of water rushing in.</p>
			<p>On a side note, when we do shut it down we have a body to reclaim as it seems that one dwarf was still in the tunnels when we opened access to the river...</p>

			<p>The entertainment center in the meeting hall is also now complete but without sufficient flow to rinse the Pit of Justice I'm hesitant to start chucking bodies down the hole to see how it works.  We will need to capture some of the participants of the next siege rather than slay them...</p>

			<h2>28th Moonst, 256</h2>
			<p>It has been a quite month since Winter arrived but today another body was discovered drained of blood.  This is the first such body since sequestering the other vampires in the switch room.  I hope this is an old body that was recently discovered rather than the prey of a new vampire.  We will have to look more closely at the last few batches of immigrants...</p>
