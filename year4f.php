			<h2>20th Moonstone</h2>
			<p>Nothing like a good goblin and minotaur stampede from within your fortress to liven things up.</p>
			<p>In the process of moving several caged creatures, the fiends broke loose and began slaughtering citizens.  Fortunately the militia has been training!  Rebellion put down.</p>
			<h2>1st Opal</h2>
			<p>In the process of quelling the goblin rebellion and cleaning up the mess, the traders packed up and left.  This makes two seasons I've missed out on traders!  Blast!</p>
			<h2>17th Opal</h2>

			<h2>1st Obsidian</h2>

			<h2>6th Obsidian</h2>
			<p>Six babies born in a week.
			<p>AND I have finally located the corpse of the dwarf who is haunting us at the bridge!  He is being laid to rest respectfully.</p>
			<h2>17th Obsidian</h2>
			<p>Ten fine iron helms and ten sturdy iron breastplates for my military.  Excellent work! My armorsmith creates masterpieces!</p>
