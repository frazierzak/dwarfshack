I told him to run like the wind and he did, all the way to the caverns to pull the lever I placed beside the drawbridge. Little did he know what side of the bridge he was suppose to be on.</p>
			<p>I will surely ask for his name in the future so I can appoint the appropriate memorial to be constructed.</p>

			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_32.png"><img class="rightshort" src="images/suc_img/year5_32.png" /></a>I've assigned everyone with at least one hand the job of stone-smoothing and engraving. I need this hall done before the winter. I have the weird feeling that it will be the last thing I do for Crestedgilt.</p>
			<p>Out of 157 dwarves there are 3 idlers, and one of them is me. The other two I'm still looking for.</p>

			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_33.png"><img class="rightshort" src="images/suc_img/year5_33.png" /></a>As the last table was being dragged into place, an overwhelming sense of accomplishment swept over me. The <strong>Bembul Grand Hall</strong> had been finished. I then ordered the construction of a giant B-shaped well in remembrance of my sweet, dear Bembul. I probably should write her at some point...</p>

			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_34.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year5_34.png" /></a>Of course! It <em>would</em> make since to have a goblin invasion at the end of the year! I've pulled everyone inside and pulled up the bridge. We're staying in for the rest of the winter. A vampire also just claimed a member of my finest squad, I really hope someone else can deal with it as I've had enough patience with these vermin.</p>
			<h2>25th of Obsidian, 255, Late Winter</h2>
			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_35.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year5_35.png" /></a>One of the trolls just murdered the tame Wolverine we had outside. The reason I know this because of the large howl I heard as it was struck down. You could hear it through every inch of the fort.</p>
			<p>It made me smile.</p>
