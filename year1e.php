			<p>During all this construction I began working on my own tomb and burial chamber. It's eerie to work on something that I know I will never use, because I plan to live forever. Nevertheless, it's comforting to know I have a nice resting place should the unthinkable happen. It is place on the same level as the river, so I can hear the monstrous carp float by.</p>

			<p>These traps are paying off already, a Giant Slug happened to get in one of the stone fall traps and squish goes the slug!</p>

You can also see the beginnings of the Main Hall in this picture as well. We need a place to sit and drink our brew and eat our food in peace, and I think this is one of the places to do it in! When new migrants come, they will come here and admire how awesome it is. (Note this is only a temporary hall mind you, my job is to get this place ship shape before the new spring, this can be moved deeper down in the stone at a later time.)</p>

It is good to see my old friends again, I hope the crafts we made are suitable.</p><div class="clear"></div><br/>
