If you look at the top right corner of the window you’ll see a red -1! If you go way up into the air with < you will see it change to a green positive number. This level is tricky to build in because we’re liable to run into rivers and lakes, which contain their water at this same level.  So let’s cut one level deeper again with more up/down stairs on Z-2.</p> 
			<p>Right now what we have is a two story shaft, 2x2, containing stairs cut into the Earth.  There’s no actual space to build anything here yet, just stairs.  Let’s make some rooms now, these will be farms later because we’re still on a soil layer.</p>
			<p>“d”esignate a path to “d”ig (or mine).  Now you can just paint with your mouse.  If you paint over an area and didn’t mean to, you can go back and clean it up with “x” which is “remove designation”.  This works anytime you are designating something.</p>

			<p><a href="images/tut_img/shaft2.jpg"><img class="right" width="50%" src="images/tut_img/shaft2.jpg"/></a>There, now we’ve designated stairs to be cut into the ground, and trees to be chopped.  One more thing, “d”esignate some “p”lants to be gathered.  Choose about the same area as your treesNote that I mined out the two southern walls of the shaft here as well as the empty black unseen space.  This will create us a small hallway and two 7x7 rooms, which we will later place underground farm plots in.  Unpause and let the miners do their work, within 2 minutes or so you’ll have your rooms.<p>
