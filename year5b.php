			<p>Crossing the two bridges I see at least ten dwarves drinking from a stream that's obviously poisoned with blood and bile. I ask one of them where I can find the previous ruler and he shrugs. I have a feeling he's hiding something. "Why are you drinking from that river?" I ask and he shrugs again, this time trying to hide a snicker. A nearby dwarf calls out 'Lucien' which causes the dwarf in front of me to quickly turn his head then scurry inside. What an odd fellow. I walk into the main entrance.</p>

			<p><strong>ARE YOU SERIOUS?</strong> More bodies. More smells. I'm close to passing out. Gylis II shows no expression. Surely he's more concerned about finding his father then the awful stench that stains our nostrils.</p>
			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_3.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year5_3.png" /></a>As we head down the hall pass the food and craftworks, I notice a dwarf mumbling to himself about "wood" while he rocks back and forth at a craftsdwarf's shop. I make note to Gylis II to quickly barricade that room until he's settled down.</p>

            <p>If you can make out this report sheet, you'll see our food stocks are plenty. But there's one problem:</p>
			<p align="center"><a href="images/suc_img/year5_4.png"><img class="bigcenter" src="images/suc_img/year5_4.png" /></a><br/>Note the sad face and exclamation marks,<br/> that's how upset I am now.</p>
			<p><strong>WHERE'S THE BOOZE!?</strong> No wonder everyone seems so depressed and sober. I quickly have Gylis order construction of 3 more stills and have our carpenters making barrels. It's at this point I realize we have NO WOOD either. An axedwarf mentions there is a few trees that grow to the south. I said cut them. He asked me how many, at which point I screamed "<strong>EVERY ONE!</strong>" to his face. He quickly left my sight. </p>
			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_5.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year5_5.png" /></a>The first tomb I find is <strong>Dirge Eristhostath</strong>. From what I've heard he was the 3rd ruler of this dump.</p>
			<p>I have some of the senior dwarves put together a missing-person list as Gylis II is still very worried about his father. I checked the never-ending tombs down below and honestly it became tiring going through the countless names of dwarves who'd died due to their ruler's incompetent hand.</p>
