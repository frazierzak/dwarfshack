            <h1 align="center">Death of dwarf Gylis the brave</h1>
			<p><strong>This is a brief story documenting massive incompetence and astounding bravery, intended to complement the diaries and documents of years 2 and 3.</strong></p>
			<p>Overload the Mad, during his destructive and tragic reign in year 2 did much damage to the livelihoods of common dwarfs. However being vain and most likely more intoxicated than average individual, he still wished that his year of rule was remembered as something more than a tragedy of highest proportion. Therefore, when a stark raving mad peasant came up with an idea of legendary trousers made out of silk (or whatever he was planning to do with the material) he sent Gylis, who was militia commander at the time, venturing into caverns, looking for spider silk.</p>
			<p>It's important for the reader realize that caverns are highly dangerous and even suckling babes know that. Alas, this knowledge eludes Overload and he sends the militia commander unarmed and alone. Almost immediately after entering the caverns Gylis encounters a forgotten beast Ye ne Asithicona, a great feathered ant. Gylis, called the brave in this document for a good reason, does not run from the ancient monster that slumbered inside the caverns. A fierce fight ensues.</p>

            <p>Although Gylis tried his best, punching the beast, it only chipped the chitin shell and bruised Asithicona. This most likely enrages the beast even more, as it bites down on dwarf's leg, shattering the hip. If that's not bleak enough, ant shook him by the leg completely ripping it off. Even after his limb sailed off in an arc, Gylis persevered, successfully dodging beast's strikes and even managed to bite and firmly latch to one of the beasts many legs, tearing its tendonds!</p>

			<p>Despite fading strength due to blood loss, Gylis managed to tear tendons of another two ant's legs! And then the beast just leaves him. It refuses to finish the dwarf off.</p>
