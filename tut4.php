			<p><span style="font-family: 'Glass Antiqua', cursive; font-size: 48px;">W</span>e see the available tile sets.  I usually prefer the Mayday tileset, but I (and the Succession games) will be using Phoebus.  A tile set is just a nice graphical placeholder for what usually by default comes out to look like pure ASCII.  Here’s the difference:</p>
			<p><a href="images\tut_img\tileset1.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="images\tut_img\tileset1.jpg" width="48%"/></a> <a href="images\tut_img\tileset2.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="images\tut_img\tileset2.jpg" width="48%"/></a></p>
			<p>Note the resolution is a bit different because of the typeset, once in-game you won’t notice this as much.</p>
			<p>NOTE: most of the tile sets DO NOT include the music.  You can fix this by copying them over manually if you enjoy hearing the guitar.</p>

			<p><strong>DFInit</strong> is an easy way to edit the init files (modding the game) without going in through notepad, nothing more.</p>
			<p><strong><a href="http://code.google.com/p/dwarftherapist/" target="_blank">Dwarf Therapist</a></strong> is a MUST HAVE utility.  I will have a section on Dwarf Therapist later, but it’s very, very simple to use and is basically a giant shortcut around the default interface when assigning jobs to dwarfs (and renaming them), seeing which professions they are good at, and so on.</p>
			<p><strong><a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Utility:SoundSense" target="_blank">SoundSense</a></strong> is an app that generates custom sounds for your dwarves and their activities.  I don’t have much exposure to it, but <a href="http://df.zweistein.cz/soundsense/" target="_blank">here’s how it works</a> (I did notice the Wilhelm Scream in there.)</p>
			<p><strong>Quickfort</strong> is a little app where you can design fort layouts (say, in MS Paint) and then paste them into your fort to be mined out.  I play with this at work sometimes and then paste designs later, but you will probably not need this for the Shack games.  ChromaFort is almost identical.</p>
