This is the simple fort that I have made. Let it be known that all of these stockpiles and workshops can be moved where ever they are needed most in the future. But as of right now, my job was to get this fortress on the right track, and I think I did that. (except for a couple mishaps) The new dwarf overseer is coming in a few days to take over. And when they do, I can get back to my work, mining! Being a miner dwarf and trying to write in a journal while swinging a pick-axe sure is difficult. I am happy this overseer position lasts only a year! Now if you'll excuse me I think the new arrival is here and I must be going, but I will leave you with these parting thoughts:</p>
			<p><ul>
				<li>18 Dwarfs are now here in CrestedGilt</li>
				<li>Booze and food (Thanks to fisher-dwarfs!) supplies are good.</li>
				<li>Make a better wall or tower around the eastern hilltop stairs.</li>
				<li>Or get rid of the eastern hill top stairs entirely.</li>
				<li>Make more traps! Defend the entrances!</li>
				<li>STRIKE THE EARTH!</li>
			</ul></p>

            <p>I stand by my words spoken in the very beginning of our journey when I said that this fortress is blessed and will only end in prosperity! To the fortress of CrestedGilt, long may you live and thrive! This is Dee-Em VII, miner extraordinaire, signing off!</p>
