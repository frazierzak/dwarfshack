			<p>This utility will automatically read the memory of your DF.EXE and give you a table with your dwarves, via nickname (if any) and list their jobs by color, highlighted in blue if they are assigned that job.</p> 
			<p>Their SKILL PROFICIENCY is indicated by a small square dot in the middle of the skill.  For example, notice my two miners have a small dot of skill in the MINING labor; they have some experience.  I could assign my Brewer to mine as well by clicking that labor on his row, and he would then go to the wagon, grab my extra pick, and pitch in as a miner!  I don’t want to do that quite yet though, for now just scroll across and notice which labors everyone has “on”.</p>
			<p><a href="images/tut_img/therapist2.jpg"><img width="50%" class="right" src="images/tut_img/therapist2.jpg"/></a>“Recover Wounded” and “Feed Patients / Prisoners” is default on for all, as well as all the “Hauling” skills.  We actually don’t want our miners to bother with hauling stuff right now, so let’s turn those off for our two miners.</p>

			<p>There, now our miners will ONLY mine.  When they’re done, they will wander back to the wagon and wait.  The “Current Job” column right next to the names of the dwarves will tell us if they’re working or hanging around like bums.  Note that sometimes a dwarf must sleep, and eat, and drink, and he will STOP what he’s doing in order to feed himself and so on.  He will resume his behavior after he’s rested.<p>
			<p>Remember our plants up on the surface?  Choose a dwarf that isn’t doing anything and assign him to “plant gathering”.  This dwarf will then go from plant to plant, as you “d”esignated, and gather berries or leaves, and leave them there on the ground (just like the wood).</p>
			<p>Look at the window near the top right, it says “Pending Labor Changes” and lists what we turned off.  You can clear those changes or commit to them… your game WILL NOT be changed until you commit your changes.  Do that now.</p>
			<p>That’s all there is to Dwarf Therapist, really!  When you get a lot of dwarves you will want to group them by profession (or migrant wave) for organization, but with 7 it’s easy to see at a glance.</p>
