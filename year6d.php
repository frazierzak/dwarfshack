			<h2>9th Malachite, 256</h2>
			<p>27 new migrants arrived today.  Surely they were drown to CrestedGuilt by the rumors of the masterpiece that Shorast completed days ago.  He called it "Viperpit".  It is an ominous grate indeed.  It fits in perfectly in the entertainment center of the new meeting hall.</p>

			<h2>17th Malachite, 256</h2>
			<p>The fools!  They've elected Uvash Dodkikud as mayor!  Clearly Uvash's charisma is legendary as inspite of being outted as a vampire this....thing....has convinced the population to let it rule.  Such madness will not be tolerated on my watch!  We will construct no accommodations nor bestow upon it any office.  Were the Pit of Justice completed this beast would become it's first victim immediately though as it stands the "mayor" will be required to remain in the switching room pulling levers at my direction.  </p>

			<p>As if getting itself elected mayor were not enough, it has the audacity to issue edicts!  No exporting of backpacks indeed....</p>

			<h2>12th Galena</h2>
			<p>The siege has returned.  Word of our prosperity at CrestedGilt has clearly gotten out.  Today our gates were seiged by a large party of trolls.  We allowed a few to to enter the fortress before sealing it completely.  Our milita handled them with few casualties but I am certain they cannot handle the legion that remains outside.  Once again our attention must focus inward.  Luckily we have fresh water this time around...</p>

			<h2>19th Limestone, 256</h2>
			<p>Autumn arrived three weeks ago.  The seasonal change plus the added stress of the current seige has driven one of our glassworkers to lock himself in a workshop and begin a mysterious construction. </p>
