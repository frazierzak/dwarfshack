			<p>Remember that every time you want a fresh picture of your dwarves and their labors, click the button on the top that says “READ DWARVES”.  DT will grab a snapshot of your dwarves at that moment.  You may want to PAUSE the game while you’re messing about in DT.</p> 
			<p>Speaking of which, you should now have two rooms cut into the dirt on Z-2.  Up on level 0, we now should have someone gathering plants, and our Carpenter is probably done cutting trees.  Note the logs on the ground, and the food from the plants sitting there where the bush used to be.  We’ll want to bring that stuff inside for storage, and keep them in a pile.</p>
			<p>So let’s dig another 2x2 up/down stairs into Z-3.  In my game this level is still soft and not rocky (silt wall for me at this level), your game may be different.  Either way, let’s make some open space for storage on this level:</p>

			<p>Eight rooms, each one 7x7 and connected here on Z-3.  Unpause and let your miners get to work!<p>
			<p>Since we’re still on a dirt layer (for me), we won’t be generating any useful stone or ore.  Dirt and sand and loam all just poof when you mine through them.  However, they are very quick to mine, and your miners will gain skill by doing so.  Also, here on Z-3, we’re far enough down where we won’t bump into any water obstacles via the river or lakes up top, so if we wanted to expand north, we could do so without any interruption.</p>
			<p>In these rooms we’re going to store stuff!  So we’re going to make “p”iles.  When the rooms are done, hit “p” and check out the menu, we can have a pile for animals, food, furniture, corpses, refuse, and so on.  Right now let’s make a “w”ood pile.</p>
			<p>Piles cannot be painted like you were mining, so position your cursor at the corner of a room, hit enter, and then arrow to the opposite corner and hit enter again.  The pile area will turn into a placemat, it looks like carbon fiber kind of.  When you unpause now, all dwarves that have the Wood Hauling labor turned on will run over, grab an armful of lumber off the ground, and take it to the pile, stacked neatly.</p>
