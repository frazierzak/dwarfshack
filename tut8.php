			<p>I’m going to pick a leader first and assign them these skills:  Leader (1), Record Keeper (1), Organizer (1), Appraiser (1), and Judge of Intent (1).  This is because those skills will be useful for keeping stock of the fort and for trading with dirty elves and humans.  I’m also going to hit “c” and then “n” to give that dwarf a nickname:  Leader.</p>
			<p>I’m also going to give two dwarves two points each in mining, and giving them a nickname of “Miner”.</p>
			<p>Next, a dwarf gets one point in woodcutting and a point in carpentry.  “Carpenter”.</p>
			<p>Next, one dwarf gets a point in fisherman and a nickname.</p>
			<p>Next, one dwarf gets a point in brewing and a point in cooking, and a nickname.</p>
			<p>Lastly, one dwarf gets a point in mechanics and one in masonry.</p>
			<p>These are my personal preferences, and some people like to make expert miners, or a military, right off the bat.  I prefer to let these skills grow organically and pick serfs up with no job to do tasks, where some get very good at that task, then they get a nickname later. Some people also like to add an Ambusher, who will automatically start out with a crossbow and a piece of leather armor, as a hunter.</p>

		<p>I prefer to wait and do this later, after I get a lay of the land and the poor guy doesn’t wander off into any waterfalls or something.</p>
		<p>I have 187 points to add gear.  Hit TAB and we’re going to adjust our load.</p>
		<p>I’m going to pick ONE male kitten.  He will hunt vermin like rats and bugs automatically and keep dwarves from getting unhappy thoughts.  Also he will surely adopt a dwarf who will then treat him as a pet.  Dying pets make dwarves VERY unhappy!  Keep this in mind, especially with <a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Catsplosion" target="_blank">cats</a>. I’m picking a male because I don’t want my pet to be having babies, and I’m picking a kitten because he won’t be available to impregnate females until he’s an adult anyway.</p>
		<p>I’m also picking one male and one female turkey, because I want to harvest eggs, and I want an eventual poultry industry.  Also, I’m going to left-arrow back over to my inventory and use “n” to add a new item: under tools, I’m adding one nest box, the cheapest available.  Turkey hens will only lay eggs in a nest box.  <a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2012:Egg" target="_blank">Eggs</a> are a decent additive to your food supply.</p>
		<p style="padding: 0; margin: 0;">You will also get one or two draft animals, like a horse or an ox, at embark, and these can be butchered and eaten as well.</p>
