God rid of the giant mess in the middle that was cluttering up the central walk ways.  I ordered Gylis's Tomb walled off so that people could not mourn a beast loving dwarf.  It's not right.</p>

			Finished the first level of the new hall.  Made all those lazy mofos clean up.  The incoming bins are cleaning the place up nicely.  The dwarfs are clamoring for new beds.  Screw them for now.  Let them sleep on the cold stone so that they may be closer to the stone goddess.</p>
            <h2>26th Slate, 257</h2>
			<p>The siege is still on.  The second great main hall is nearing half way to being complete.</p>
			<h2>8th Hematite, 257</h2>
			<p>At some point over the night the siege has lifted.  I think they killed the caravan on the way out.  I had been staring at them daily across the bridge with an evil menacing way with my great hammer out and stroking my beard.  I also heard that bolange was walking around with his cock out and they all died of laughter.  Not sure which ran them off, but they are gone and we are all better for it.  Now if we can only figure out to lower the bridge.</p>
