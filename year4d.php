			<h2>15th Malachite</h2>
			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year4_10.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year4_10.png" /></a>The stupid beast is fighting with a wombat leather shoe.  No wonder he is taking so long to kill the goblins.</p>
			<h2>20 Malachite</h2>
			<p>Miasma from the butcher shop is polluting my stockpiles, but the last goblin is dead.  I am tempted to drop the bridge to air out the fort!</p>
			<p>Alas, I cannot, the bull beast is hovering around the site of the battle and my dwarves will want to claim bodies and gear.  For now I will wait.</p>
			<p><strong>(And then my game crashed, erasing all my work since I did not save.  That will teach me to leave the process running, fail.)</strong></p>
			<h2>4 Granite</h2>
			<p>YE GODS THERE BE BLOOD AND RAGS AND POOLS OF GOBLIN SEMEN EVERYWHERE.</p>
			<p>Wait, this sounds familiar...</p>

			<h2>NEW SUMMARY up until the summer</h2>
			<p>Dirge died to insanity, taking out a couple of new migrants before he was ended by my newest squad, consisting of the vampiric mayor.</p>
			<p>The legendary Chef became possessed and crafted a hematite crown.</p>
			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year4_11.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year4_11.png" /></a>Goblin siege happened again, and one goblin got stuck on a Giant Toad named Dang.</p>
			<p>I pissed off the elves because there was a wooden crutch in a pile of stuff I tried to sell them.  Oh well.</p>
			<h2>24th Malachite</h2>
			<p>I have almost finished construction of my secret project, we are under siege but the goblins are positioned at the small bridge at the river.</p>
			<p>I still have one vampire lurking somewhere in my fortress but I've been unable to locate him as of yet.</p>
			<p>The elves will likely not declare war on us, but I am anticipating new traders soon to acquire some wood and food/drink.</p>
