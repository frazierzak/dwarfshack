			<p>As a result of these shocking lapses in basic security, our fort is beset by enemies both within and without.  Our workers are dying pitiful deaths unworthy of dwarven heroes on the surface at the filthy hands of goblins.  Babies have been kidnapped, been murdered, and their remains lie where they fell.</p>

			<p>And now, as a new year dawns, I, Etur Erithostath, though I am but a lowly furnace operator, have appointed myself militia commander of Zimoltar and placed the fortress under martial law.  I shall take the war name "Dirge", for I shall strike fear into the hearts of our enemies and commemorate those we have lost.</p>

            <p>I wish I could have lived in a happier time, free to cultivate the craft and culture of our people.  But I do what I must.  I do this for my wife and child, and for all my other dwarfkin in Zimoltar, for our fortunes rise and fall together.  I only hope that it is not already too late for all of us.</p>
			<p>My first act will be a defensive reorganization of our labor force and a withdrawal from the surface.  For now we must trust to our traps to keep the goblins from entering.  If we cannot rout the horror within our walls, all is lost.</p>

			<p>It is worse than I feared. We are almost out of wine.</p>
