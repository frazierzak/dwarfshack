			<h2>28th Felsite, 256</h2>
			<p>Summer has arrived.  And just ast the mild temperatures of spring have left us, so have the goblins outside.  If only the caravan could have waited another week he would have left with a very profitable venture instead of only leaving with his life.</p>
			<p>Additionally, my quarters are finally completed!  I waste no time in moving in and hope to be able to test the Sacrificial Pit of Justice before too long.</p>
			<p>I also ordered the construction of a protective set of wall grates to isolate the entryway of CrestedGuilt and the two training barracks from the remainder of our fortress.  I hope these grates are never needed but an extra layer of defense may allow us to keep our gate open while not allowing nonessential personnel to venture outside.  Further more I've ordered our vampires to relocate to the main switch room.  They will become our dedicated lever pullers to control the fortress' automation.</p>
			<h2>4th Hematite, 256</h2>
			<p>Shorast Zasoltar, one of our carpenter dwarves, has been driven mad by the strange energies of CrestedGuilt.  He has taken it upon himself to create some magnificent creation.</p>

A number of our dead inhabitants have returned from the beyond to cause us problems.  We shall need to construct additional coffins and slabs to ensure they rest peacefully.</p>
			<h2>21st Hematite, 256</h2>
			<p>We've done it!  The river has been tapped and our sewers have began to fill for their initial test  Mere days ago two dwarves died of thirst (though I am not sure how as the front gate was open).  If only they could have held out they could have had fresh clean water while remaining safely inside...</p>
