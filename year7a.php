While the trees continue to blow in the wind, and birds sing to... whoever the hell they sing to, a dark mist spreads through the hallways today.  I have been concerned of the rumblings outside of our walls for days.  Bolange, our previous overseer, had previously been acting in his usual queer way, but yesterday came screaming through the hallways.  I heard the commotion and was annoyed.  I just wanted to drink some mead and do regular dwarf things like fart and chew on my toe nails.  I happen to step out precisely at the time he got to my door.  He pleaded with me to take the reins of this failure he calls a fortress and to take care of the army of goblins outside of our very gate.</p>

			<p>I pondered this for a moment.  I ceded to myself that this fortress could be great in the hands of a great leader.  A strong leader.  A fucking bad ass barbarian.  No one was more badass than me.  So I accepted.</p>
			<p>I will now be known as Conandan the Barbarian Dwarf of Fear and Lamentation.  The only way an awesome dwarf could rule an awesome fortress would be to give it an awesome name.  Some animal humper was unfortunately the namer of this fortress.  So I will change it.  The name of our glorious home is now STAR DEATH FORTRESS.  These are trying times.  As such, all that dissent will be killed.</p>
			<p>Now is the time for protecting our home, but there are priorities in a dwarfs life once he attains power.  He must right the wrongs of those that have done him wrong.  Everyone praised the name of Gylis, the furious lover of goats and their rectums.  I will not see the glorious name of our fortress besmirched by a tomb to such a slimey dwarf.  It is time to remove this wart, once and for all, right after we smash the breath from every living thing that seeks to destroy us and our ways.  But before we can hope to accomplish this, we must train, we must plot, and we must grow harder, faster, stronger.  We also need some fucking manners and some god damn organization. </p>
			<p>The time of leadership and fear is upon us.  Buck up dwarves, it's going to be a hard ride.</p>
