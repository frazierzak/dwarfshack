			<h2>28 Moonstone</h2>
			<p>The diggers have found warm stone deep below the surface.  I look first for watery caverns to dig our wells into, but magma is close, so close.</p>
			<h2>11 Opal</h2>
			<p>The forgedwarf Ber Fikonkonad has been possessed with the urge to create some wonderous work of metal!  The entire fortress holds its breath in anticipation.</p>
			<h2>17 Opal</h2>
			<p>Brave digger Thikut Sazirkol tunneled too deep today, and fell to fiery death in a great magma sea.  We mourn yet another loss, but we welcome the magma, for it will fuel Crestedgilt's glory.  He shall be remembered forever, for he also found something greater than our craftiest dreams.  Raw adamantine! PRAISE THE MINERS!</p>

			<h2>18 Opal</h2>
			<p>The great Minotaur Bikda Gujegadic Issok Vope has been sighted on the surface! Let us pray that our well-crafted cinnabar bridge holds strong against it.</p>
			<h2>23 Opal</h2>
			<p>Ber has, at last, completed her great work.  We are all breathtaken by this perfect iron shoe, which commemorates both the deadliness of our clever traps and the tastiness of our tasty biscuits.</p>
