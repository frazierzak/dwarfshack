			<h2>27 Hematite</h2>
			<p>The vampire became wounded by the goblins but crawled away and is now oozing pus all over the field.  Most of the militia succumbed at the hands of the goblins as well, filled with arrows.  Among them, Dirge.</p>
			<p>And what's this new monstrosity?   The Minotaur has returned</p>
			<p align="center"><a href="images/suc_img/year4_6.png"><img class="center" src="images/suc_img/year4_6.png" /></a></p>
			<p align="center">Perhaps it will eat the goblins!</p>
			<p>The drawbridge is raised but the elven caravan escaped safely despite the siege.  All my work collecting corpses and putting good dwarven souls to rest is for naught, we have no militia to combat the goblins at this point, so I will hole up and concentrate on the engineering.  We have purchased some food and drink from the elves, perhaps this will sustain us for a bit.</p>
			<p>Aha, the vampire has encountered the Minotaur!</p>

            <p><a href="images/suc_img/year4_7.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year4_7.png" /></a>And the vampire falls!  Additionally the beast ran back to the siege area.  We shall see.</p>
			<h2>2nd Malachite</h2>
			<p>And yes!  The beast has engaged the goblin siege, let us see what comes of it.</p>
			<p align="center"><a href="images/suc_img/year4_8.png"><img class="center" src="images/suc_img/year4_8.png" /></a></p>
			<h2>11 Malachite</h2>
			<p>The goblins continue to battle the massive bull-headed beast.  The field is awash in gore, bones, and piss.</p>
			<p>There is but one goblin remaining, and the siege is broken.   However the minotaur is barely scratched, with only a small wound on his upper leg, despite the goblin attack.</p>
			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year4_9.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year4_9.png" /></a>Once the last green meanie is dead I will leave the beast to his roaming, and perhaps he will vanish again.  I cannot fight such a foe.  Yet.</p>
