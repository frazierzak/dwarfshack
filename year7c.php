			<h2>13th Hematite, 257</h2>

			Some idiot went crazy and holed himself up in the craftdwarf shop demanding a bunch of stuff we don't have.  I feared he might hurt someone so I proactively walled him off from the others.  Everyone seemed eager to help out.</p>
			<h2>1st Galena</h2>
			<p>Some stupid mother fuckers wondered outside somehow.  I am not sure how they got out there, but now they are dead.  The damn goblins are waiting outside of STAR DEATH FORTRESS.  Fuckers ambushed them I guess.  Gylis's son started crying because the carnage made him remember his dad.  I laughed and carved out some new areas for large mushroom growth.   We need wood badly.</p>
			<h2>7th Galena, 257</h2>
			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year7_8.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year7_8.png" /></a>
			A great monster with the head of a shitty cow has been spotted outside of the gates.  If we are lucky he will just pass by.  Stone goddess help us all.</p>

			He still sits.  It is raining, and he sits.  It has been 10 days since he arrive yet nothing.  I fear that it will drive us mad.  Bolange is already talking of showing the monster his wiener.  I think that this would be unwise.</p>
			<h2>19th Galena, 257</h2>
			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year7_10.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year7_10.png" /></a>
			The stone goddess hates us it seems.  The goblins siege us again.  What will the monster do?  I grimace all day and Gylis's son fears me.  I hope this continues.</p>
			<h2>22nd Galena, 257</h2>
			<p>The human caravan arrived and was immediately slaughtered by the goblin invasion.  I don't know whether to laugh, smile or be sad for the mules.</p>
