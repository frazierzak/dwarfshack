			<p><span style="font-family: 'Glass Antiqua', cursive; font-size: 48px;">T</span>omorrow I leave for yon dwarven outpost Crestedgilt, taking barely me own hammer and a cask of rum, as I've heard the new post is a burgeoning haven run by the very best and brightest of dwarves, aye.  What better a place for a builder and engineer such as meself!  No doubt I will be welcomed quickly into the fold and pass through marble gates into the glorious halls of Zimoltar.</p>

			<p>YE GODS THERE BE BLOOD AND RAGS AND POOLS OF GOBLIN SEMEN EVERYWHERE.  No doubt from the righteous buggering they've given us, apparently!  Unable to turn about and flee back to the mountainhomes, my only hope was to rush the drawbridge and scream to be let in.
I met the former leader, now a broken shell of a dwarf, and he drunkenly filled me in on the details. By my beard, this isn't looking good at all.  My own dreams of building vast dwarven wonders are shattered, I must assume leadership of the outpost and try to right it!
Perhaps most distressing is the revelation that the mayor herself is a vampire.</p>

However I'm told there is a Minotaur roaming the area, he will be my first challenge, as I need to clear the way for dwarves to clean up our dead before too many more ghostly sightings appear.</p>

			<p>Alas, no sooner have I lowered yon drawbridge and stationed the militia outside the gates to protect the cleanup crew, than the drunken and despondent former leader throws a tantrum.  Better ye than me, old sod.</p>

			<p>Ah, no wait, mayhap I don't have to kill the poor chap after all, he has calmed himself.</p>
