But you must be careful, there have been reports of GIANT WOLVERINES down there where the tree and bushes are. Be careful!</p>
			<p>Since these are untamed lands my first priority is to build some simple traps in our entry way, making a mechanic's workshop and using the mechanisms he makes there I created many stone fall traps in the mouth of the entrance, hopefully that keeps the riff raff out!</p>

On top of the eastern mountain there is a giant orange W! Erm, I mean a Giant Wolverine, but judging from the description, I don't know what it is, I don't want to mess with it, I know that.</p>

It's a good thing I made stone fall traps in the entrance first thing because he chased our dwarfs inside the cave! (I made a burrow in the fort and made everyone run in there) As he was licking his chops trying to eat us,  a stone fall trap hit him in the front leg, knocking him unconscious! After getting back up and walking outside he then fell unconscious again and then took off.....biding his time no doubt.</p>

			<p>He didn't know what hit him, but I do. A chunk of shale! I should know, I mined it!</p>
