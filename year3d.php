			<h2>11 Granite</h2>
			<p>My predecessor in Zimoltar's leadership, the weaponsmith Overload Igathmafol, was found dead yesterday.  He will be mourned, like so many others.  However, another ray of hope: it appears the goblins at our gate have departed, perhaps sated on dwarven blood for the moment.  I will not waste this respite.</p>

			<h2>13 Granite</h2>
			<p>I have planned the construction of crude but stout walls around our main entrance.  I have also ordered the diggers to create a channel in front of them, that we shall bridge with a drawbridge.  When this is completed, we will have some means of truly forbidding entrance to the goblin invaders and the enraged wolverines.</p>
			<h2>23 Granite</h2>
            <p>After months of laboring in vain on some unknown project, Catten Idsibrek was struck with melancholy today.  I can only wonder what Catten might have produced had the silk cloth he wanted so badly been available.  We will never know.  In better times, perhaps.</p>

			<h2>8 Slate</h2>
			<p>Thirty-three migrants arrived from the Mountainhomes today.  This is wonderful news, as morale has been perilously low here, with some dwarves throwing tantrums in their grief and rage.  I can only hope the fresh faces will lift spirits.</p>
			<p>As we construct the fortifications by the front entrance, I have also begun excavation of a new barracks just inside.  I am arranging two permanent squads of dwarves who will train continuously against further attack.  I have also promoted additional builders -- trained masons who can help construct the fortifications.  And help cut coffins for the bodies of the dead, which still remain outside, unclaimed.  I dare not risk dwarves to gathering the corpses and possessions of the fallen until we have tombs for them.</p>
			<h2>9 Felsite</h2>
			<p>The crude front fortifications are complete.  We need only link the bridge to the cinnabar lever I have placed in the northwest corner of the meeting hall, and we will finally have a way of shutting out goblin invaders entirely.  Well, at least unless they can jump the fortifications.  The next step is building a roof over them.</p>
