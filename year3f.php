			<h2>14 Hematite</h2>
			<p>Our other digger went insane with melancholy today.  I wonder if I can be far behind.  The goblins, at last, have fled, routed by our traps.</p>
			<p>A handful of migrants arrived.  I will see if I can rebuild... but for what?</p>
			<h2>25 Malachite</h2>
			<p>Cutting more tombs.  To relieve the workload on our new, poorly-trained diggers, the new tombs will be smaller.</p>
			<p>We are low on barrels and drinks, but at least the tombs are well-stocked.</p>
			<h2>27 Malachite</h2>
			<p>One of our forgedwarves was possessed by unknown forces today and took to a forge to work on a secret project.  Perhaps he will create a superweapon that will save us all.</p>
			<h2>6 Galena</h2>
			<p>Not a superweapon, but a legendary iron right gauntlet of the finest craftsdwarfship.  It depicts the settlement of Crestedgilt in 251.  Those were happier days.  Still, I am satisfied that this fine artifact was created on my watch.</p>

			<h2>10 Galena</h2>
			<p>Our fortunes fall together.  Today our woodcutter, who had been severly injured, died of thirst in his illness.  Yet another did not go thirsty -- a corpse was found drained of blood.  Vampires stalk our halls.  I will launch a full investigation.</p>
			<h2>19 Galena</h2>
			<p>A human caravan arrived today from Omon Shasstol, with wagons laden with goods. We shall trade for some badly needed supplies.</p>
			<h2>2 Limestone</h2>
			<p>Trade with the humans went well.  In particular, we acquired badly needed lumber and some of their strange sewer brew.</p>
