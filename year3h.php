			<h2>15 Timber</h2>
			<p>Another ambush. Curse them!  However, this time we are ready, at least to resist them.  I shall call the dwarves inside and close the gate against the intruders.</p>
			<p>Postscript: Our caravan from the Mountainhomes and our outpost liaison arrived just behind the foul goblins! I shall attempt to keep the gate open, and hope the caravan guards can dispatch the ambushers.</p>
			<h2>21 Timber</h2>
			<p>The caravan is broken and routed!  I have shut the gate.  I intend to keep it closed through the winter.  It may be hard, but Crestedgilt will endure.</p>

			<p>And we will delve.  With the gate closed, we must dig a well into some deep water for our thirst.  And for too long have we relied on timber for fuel.  I think it's time we dug for magma, to fuel our forges.  With our abundance of hematite and the heat of the earth, we should be able to craft an armory that can shatter these goblin thugs.</p>
			<h2>26 Timber</h2>
			<p>A goblin thief was trapped inside the fort when the gates closed for winter!  We have slain him, but at heavy cost.</p>
			<h2>28 Timber</h2>
			<p>The outpost liaison was sealed in when the gate closed.  The Mountainhomes wish to make Crestedgilt a barony, and our mayor has suggested that I be its baron!  I am scarcely worthy of the honor, but Crestedgilt shall be a metropolis yet.</p>
			<p>There is no sign of goblin, so I shall open the gates to allow the liaison to travel home with this grand news.  I have also begun construction of my baronial quarters.  And quarters for the good mayor, of course.</p>
			<p>Of course.</p>
