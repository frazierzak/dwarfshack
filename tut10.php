I’ll go over our immediate short-term goals here and get us started by building some initial workshops, a wall or two, and most importantly, stairs down into the ground and a nice subterranean set of rooms. Additionally, we’ll plan ahead for cleanliness and resources.</p>
			<p>The <a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2012:Quickstart_guide" target="_blank">quickstart</a> guide on the wiki is a VERY good resource, and will probably mirror my own suggestions for the most part (because I used it extensively when I was learning).</p>

			<p><strong>NEED #1</strong>: You need to get out of the open and into the Earth, either straight down into the ground or by digging into a nearby hillside. Don’t worry yet about traps or defense unless you’ve embarked in a wild or evil area, goblins usually do not arrive to harass you for a year, perhaps two. And your wagon has a temporary supply of food and drink, hopefully enough to last until you get a decent set of rooms dug out.</p>
			<p><a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2012:Design_strategies" target="_blank">Fortress design</a> and layout is varied and (can be) intricate, and everyone has their own style.  Some people build elaborate fractal designs, others build very simple hallways and rooms.  For now we should just concentrate on getting the rooms functional and getting everyone inside and dwarfy.</p>
