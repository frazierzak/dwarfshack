			<p>I had planned on creating a vast MAGMA PUMP STACK, however the lack time to make proper magma-safe materials with which to build pumps, as well as the scope of the project itself, combined with the need for some real weaponry and armor, has convinced me to build some forges down at the highest magma layer.  It's a long way down (F2) but I can create some stockpiles for the smiths.</p>
			<h2>8th Sandstone</h2>
			<p>More migrants have arrived, more labor and some more military to draft.  Soon I will have to carve out some more bedrooms, but for now there is a dorm.</p>
			<p>I'm also considering building a danger room, especially if I can get one of those nasty vampires to pull the lever!  Training up a proper military is mandatory in this land.</p>
			<p>The siege is over and most all corpses are recovered.  I will probably also want to build some more coffins, unfortunately.  Poor lot.</p>

			<p>One magma forge and three magma smelters.  Storage below is for raw ore (metals) and the expansion will be bins of forged bars for the weaponsmith and armorsmith.  The completed products will be trucked upstairs.</p>
			<h2>2nd Moonstone</h2>
			<p>The magma forge and smelters are complete, and production has begun with the help of some miners digging out a hematite vein.  Iron may be the best we can hope for until we prospect around a bit more and locate some good stuff, but we may end up trading for steel in the meantime.</p>
			<p>Speaking of trading, there's a stubborn ghostly dwarf camped out on my bridge, and he's scaring away the caravans!  I have TOP DWARVES searching for his corpse but I'm unsure where it might be.  In the meantime he keeps spawning legions of rats, who quickly get eviscerated by my cats.</p>
			<p>None of this appears to stop the gentle folk of the fortress from drinking from the river however.</p>
