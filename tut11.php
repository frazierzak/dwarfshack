			<p>Your game window is probably divided into three sections right now.  On the left you’ll see your dwarfs and the wagon and the immediate area, probably some trees and rocks, maybe a stream.  In the middle is a list of commands, and on the right is a map of the entire embark area.  TAB will cycle through several combinations of these, eventually you’ll probably want to just keep 2/3rd of the screen on the left side as your live action window, and the remaining 3rd on the right as your commands.  Right now though, just take a look around:</p>
			<p><strong>The "k" key will describe the item(s) directly beneath your cursor.</strong> This is both inside and outside your fort.</p>
			<p><strong>East, West, North, and South movement</strong> is done with the arrow keys.</p>
			<p><strong>Moving UP and DOWN Z levels</strong> is done with < and >.  You’ll get very familiar with all these basic navigations.</p>

			<p>If you get lost, <strong>F1</strong> will zoom you to your wagon.</p>

			<p>Notice that if you go down one Z level while you’re looking at a river or a brook, you will see the actual river and the sides of it even one level down.</p>
			<p>Keep this in mind; you don’t want to mine into a river by accident and your dwarves will CANCEL any tiles designated for mining if they feel damp stone or soil, forcing you to pause and examine the situation. This can happen even one Z level down from the lowest level of water.</p>
			<p>For example, it might be pretty obvious when you’re mapping out an area to be dug out when you can see the river there at Z -1, but at Z -2 it becomes less intuitive; there are still tiles that are “next to” a water source, it’s just that the water source is ABOVE you.  So you will still get some pausing and canceling of designated mining at Z -2, usually these are safe to mine.</p>
