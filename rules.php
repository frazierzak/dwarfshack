            <h1>Rules of DwarfShack 2012</h1>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>1.</strong> Each player has to play 1 Year (starting at the beginning of the winter season)</li>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>2.</strong> At the beginning of your reign name a dwarf after yourself, do not rename any dwarfs that were already given nicknames by other players.</li>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>3.</strong> You're welcome to take requests from shackers that will not be playing to name dwarfs after them. This is mostly to increase interest from the rest of the community and create more buzz. However naming dorfs after other players, while encouraged, is not mandatory. Use your best judgement and don't name every single dwarf in the fortress. Future rulers will have to name some poor fellow after themselves too.</li>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>4.</strong> Send the save file to me (Gylis), once your year is finished</li>
            </ul>
        </div><!--cont_left-->
        <div id="cont_right">
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>5.</strong> Each player has to write up his reign as best as he can. I'm not imposing any more rules here, but use your best judgement to make it a hopefully interesting read. Don't make stuff up, some artistic details are allowed though.</li>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>6.</strong> Pics. This is the shack after all</li>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>7.</strong> Your reign and write up should take up to around a week, if you think that you won't be able to accomplish that contact me and we'll work something out.</li>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>8.</strong> Have FUN, but don't destroy the fortress, if you do and there are still people that want to play we'll probably restart from the beginning of your reign</li>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>9.</strong> Putting notes that explain what levers and places are meant to do would be a nice gesture</li>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>10.</strong> I probably forgot to include something here, so I'll make up some rules when you break them.</li>
            </ul>
