			<p>One of the senior dwarves brought me a list, and I sadly handed it to Gylis II.</p>

			<p>I promise him we'll do our best to find his father, but first we must get this fortress in working order.</p>
			<h2>11th of Granite, 255, Early Spring</h2>
			<p>I happened to come upon a miner who was furiously digging erratically through layers and layers of stone, breaking into other dwarves' rooms. I asked him why in the Gods name he was doing it, he told me one '<strong>Lucien</strong>' told him to. I'm guessing that's who our previous Overseer was, and he obviously doesn't want me to find out. </p>

            <p>I soon discover why he was digging this out, and it's a hematite vein. The magma forge and smelters below have been burning constantly, turning out set after set of armor for the military. It's like they're preparing for the end-times. </p>
			<p>I think I also know why this 'Lucien' was snickering. I found a room without much purpose, but it's quite clear what he had in mind.</p>

			<p><a href="images/suc_img/year5_10.png"><img class="right" src="images/suc_img/year5_10.png" /></a>I finally got some wood into this fortress, and that dwarf on the brink of insanity made a nifty Figurine of Nako Spatteredsins. A name I've been trying ever since to forget.</p>

			<p>More migrants arrived, despite the danger. This is bad as we are still not started producing the booze to supply the population we had currently! More barrels, more booze! It seems to be the only thing I have time to work on now.</p>
