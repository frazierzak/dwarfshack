			<p>Bravo!  Create another “p”ile in another one of your storage rooms, this one  is going to be “f”ood.  In fact, we have quite a bit of food, so you may want to create two rooms worth of space.  Dwarves will now begin carrying in berries and leaves from the bushes we’re gathering from, as well as food stocks from our wagon!  The goal is to eventually disassemble the wagon completely once we’re moved in.</p>
			<p>Another pile we will want will be F”u”rniture.  This includes empty barrels, beds, chests, doors, and all sorts of stuff we will be making.   Additionally, we also want a room for Finished “G”oods, which includes mechanisms (which you’ll need plenty of), crafts, cut gems, and a large quantity of created items and parts, you’ll definitely want two rooms for Goods, even if they don’t fill up right now.</p>
			<p>Next, make one room with “b”ar / block, the last one we’re going to cut into 4ths:  a different “p”ile in each corner of the room.  Make the last room have four piles:  Ammo, Weapons, Cloth, and Leather.  Do this by just making four smaller squares of each pile in that room.  They might be odd sizes, don’t worry if they don’t all have the same number of tiles.</p>

			<p>Congratulations, this storage area is an excellent start!  Whenever a dwarf needs something, he will come upstairs to this level and grab what he needs.  Let’s take one last moment and create a new pile, only OUTSIDE… a garbage (“r”efuse) pile.</p>
			<p> You may notice your kitten killing the odd mouse or two, or other vermin.  Dead stuff in your fort is bad, it will begin to rot and then stink, creating miasma.  To prevent this, make a 7x7 “p”ile outside and make it a “r”efuse pile.  Dwarves will grab garbage and bodies and plop it on the heap, where the wind will make sure there’s no stink, and eventually corpses will rot into bones.  Note that unless told otherwise, dwarves will not collect corpses or trash from topside!  Only from within the fort.<p>
			<p> What next!  You may have noticed that your dwarves are falling asleep wherever they fall down, exhausted.  In the hall, outside, in the rain… let’s build them a dormitory and some beds.</p>
