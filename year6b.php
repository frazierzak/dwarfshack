			<h2>4th Granite, 256</h2>
			<p>Shortly after construction began slow proceeding I received word of another body found drained of blood.  Something must be done about this and so I undertook my next order of business.  A survey of the population was conducted to find the individuals most likely to be the suspected vampires.  After narrowing it down to a dozen or so likely dwarves a closer inspection of them revealed three individuals who are almost certainly the demon spawn.  I feel confident in my investigative work and so I shall name the suspects here:</p>
			<ul style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;">
				<li>Uvash Dodokikud (aka Kel Bibanmebuzth)</li>
				<li>Lor Alathulzest (aka "Vampire" Amembal)</li>
				<li>Mistem Medtobgemesh (alias unknown)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lor Alathulzest was already in custody which backs my investigative work.  The other two suspects were confined to the Hall of Dick for further observation.</p>
			<p>And speaking of wood, the carpenters have been clamoring that we are all out of logs so no further beds or bins may be constructed.</p>

            <h2>5th of Slate</h2>
			<p>Another 3 children have already been born this month!  The stress of CrestedGuilt clearly has our population DTF and the results are showing.  Between immigration and births it almost seems a third of our population is useless children...</p>
			<h2>21st Felsite, 256</h2>
			<p>The population has began to clamor for water.  With the goblins outside we cannot risk opening our gates and so we must pray that the construction proceeds more quickly to quench our mighty thirsts.  Furthermore, the caravan has grown very angry at not being allowed to leave.  We mistakenly gave him our trade goods rather than bartering them to him and yet in his insolence he speaks harshly to me?  This shall not be tolerated.  We seize his goods and deconstruct the trade depot.  We need the woods anyway.</p>

			<p>Our illustrious mayor has also decreed that we not export figurines.  Little did he realize we'll be exporting nothing at all this season.</p>
