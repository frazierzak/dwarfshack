			<p><a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Water" target="_blank"><strong>Liquid depth</strong></a> describes how deep a tile of water is.  Turned on, you will see a full tile of water represented by the number 7.  This means it’s a block of water that reaches from the floor to the top of that block.  The same goes for magma.  If you breach a wall in your fort and there’s a lake on the other side, water will rush in and begin filling up tiles (sometimes very quickly) and the tiles will fill up from 1 to 7.  Any water puddle with a depth of 1 will eventually evaporate (leaving mud).  Magma will do likewise!  Dwarves will (attempt to) cross water tiles with depth at 3 or less, although they will still be subject to flow and may be dragged downstream if the water is flowing.  I’ve never turned this option off.</p>

            <p><strong>Population cap.</strong>  This is how many dwarves your fort will contain at max, by default it is 200.  Your fort will grow via migrants, who occasionally show up in waves, depending on how successful you are and how desirable your fort is to live in, as well as your reputation.  I find that 200 is a lot of dwarves to track and keep happy, but I usually leave this as is.  Some players limit their forts to a mere handful of dwarves, like 10 or 20!</p>
			<p><strong><a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Child" target="_blank">Child cap</a></strong> - Right now, children are a concern in this latest iteration of DF, because there appears to be a LOT of them coming in with migrants.  This variable however only determines pregnancies from within your fort.  I leave this as is, usually.</p>

			<p><strong><a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Aquifer" target="_blank">Aquifers</a></strong> - Giant pains in the ass.  An aquifer is a layer of ground-water-bearing rock or soil, and if you mine through it, water rushes out and floods your passage.  And potentially your entire fort.  Left at default, the game places aquifers all over the place, and it’s a fair engineering feat to overcome it.  Therefore, if you’re new, I recommend turning this off.  The Shack Succession game will NOT have aquifers turned on.</p>
			<p><strong>Exotic animals</strong> is a variable that, if turned off, will allow weird wild creatures to be easily tamed and captured.</p>
			<p>I recommend leaving the key bindings at default, as learning where all that stuff is is a huge part of learning the game and fiddling with it will detach you from others who learned the defaults (as odd as they may be).</p>
